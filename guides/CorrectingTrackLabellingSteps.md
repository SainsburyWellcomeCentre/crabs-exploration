# Guide to correcting track labels

Authors: Nik Khadijah Nik Aznan and Sof√≠a Mi√±ano

The tracks to correct (frames and csv file) will typically be in a subdirectory under

```
/ceph/zoo/users/sminano/crabs_tracks_label/<clip-subdirectory>
```

Below we outline the steps on how to correct the data.

## Steps

### 0. Mount the server from `ceph` with the frames and tracks to correct

- Remember that to mount the server you need to be connected to the SWC network (or SWC VPN)
- In Mac, mounting the server can be done in the Finder app, pressing CMD+K and writing the following address:
  ```
  smb://ceph-gw02.hpc.swc.ucl.ac.uk
  ```
- Once the directory with the csv file is mounted, we can access it under `Volumes` in Mac. For example, for an escape clip called `09.08.2023-01-Right-Triggered1.mov`, the path could look like:
  ```
  /Volumes/zoo/users/sminano/crabs_tracks_label/09.08.2023-01-Right-Triggered1/
  ```

### 1. Download and launch the VIA annotation tool

- Access the online version of the tool [here](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/via.html) or download it locally [via this link](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/) (click on `Downloads` > `Image annotator` section and download the zip file).
- It is very lightweight, browser-based and can be run offline.
- If you download the tool locally, launch it by selecting the `via.html` file from the expanded zip archive

### 2. Define the project settings

If we are launching the tool for the first time for a new project:

- Click on the gear icon on the top bar to go to `Settings`
- Edit the following settings:

  - `Project Name`: use the name of the parent directory (i.e., the name of the clip) and add `_corrected_`+ your initials as a suffix. For example, for Sofia and the clip `09.08.2023-01-Right-Triggered1.mov`:
    ```
    09.08.2023-01-Right-Triggered1_corrected_SM
    ```
  - `Default Path`: this will be the starting point of the file explorer when loading the images to label, so we want the folder with the frames we want to label here. For the example above, the default path to input would be:
  <!-- ToDO -->

  ```
  /Volumes/zoo/users/sminano/crabs_tracks_label/09.08.2023-01-Right-Triggered1/
  ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> A trailing slash is needed!

- Leave the rest of the settings with their default values
- Click `Save`
- NOTE: We found the default path bit doesn't work very reliably, so sometimes you will need to browse the image to label and select them manually.

### 3. Load the data to label

- Import the csv file with the tracks for this clip: `Annotations` > `Import annotations (from csv)`

  - It will look for the image files in the same directory as the csv.

- If the frames aren't loaded automatically:

  - On the left hand side, find the `Project` section and click on the `Add Files` button
  - Select the frames to load. Multiple selection is allowed, and also across folders at the same level (at least in Mac üçé)

- Once loaded, use the left/right arrows to navigate through the images

### 4. Correcting the tracks

- Now you see all the images and the bounding boxes with a bounding box number.

  - Notice that when we flick through the frames, the numbers on the bounding boxes change! This is because this is not the track ID.

- Make sure the track id is shown instead of the bounding box number. - To do so, press the up key. The Up key toggles between `region label cleared `or `region label set to region attribute [track]`. To show the track ID, we want the second one `region label set to region attribute [track]`.

  > [!TIP]
  > Pressing the bottom key will change the colour of the bounding box, but notice that the colour is not consistent across frames. However, it may be helpful to disentangle boxes when they are overlapping.

- Recommended approach:
  - Select a crab ID to follow across frames.
    > [!TIP]
    > You can highlight the crab with a certain ID by using the Annotation editor. To show this editor, click under `Attributes` > `Toggle Annotation Editor`. Then click on the row with the track ID of interest.
    > Be careful now, when it is highlighted, if you press right key, the bounding box will be shifted to the right. Just click anywhere to disable the highlight.
  - If the crab you are following has no bounding box in one of the frames: copy from previous frame.
    - Use `ctrl+c` to copy the box from the same crab in the previous frame, then paste it (`ctrl+v`) on the current frame. This ensures we pass the same track ID. You can adjust the bounding box to where the crab is either by dragging with your mouse or using the arrow keys.
  - If the crab you are following is assigned to a new ID (i.e., has been re-ID): change all the annotations to match the ID in the previous frames.
    - In the menu bar, select the grid icon (6th icon after `Help` menu).
      - All the frames will be shown in a grid style.
    - Choose `Group by` `region [track]` - a selector for the track number will pop up next to it.
    - Choose the number the id has been re-id to. - For example: if the original ID is 9, and the crab is now been re-ID to 78, then choose `78/188: track = 78` - Notice that the first number shown in the dropdown menu options does not necessarily match the second one (track = 78). The one we care about is the ID, so the second one. - Toggle the Annotation Editor. - If the field for editing the track ID is not editable: make sure all frames shown in the grid are selected. If they are, try clicking a few times in the Toggle Annotation Editor - If it is visible, unclick and click again! - make sure the track shows the track you choose only instead of `xxx different values:...` - Change the track in there, from the one is being re-id to the original one. - for example from 78 to 9 - Then click anywhere (or enter), there will notification at the bottom of the window saying `updated region attribute of <how many> region` - Click the same icon again so you will get only one frame back. - See if the changes happened correctly. - You do not need to wait the grid images finished loading before doing any of the step above.
      > [!CAUTION]
      > There is no undo action make sure the id you put is correct. Try to save after every id or so.

---

- If it is easier to go by track id, go from id 1 follow the id in between frames. You can just press the right key and see the movement of the bounding box and the track id.

- If you cannot easily find the number you want, click toggle annotation editor, go to the track you want, it will be highlighted in the frame.
  - Be careful now, when it is highlighted, if you press right key, the bounding box will be shifted to the right. Just click anywhere to disable the highlight.
- If the id you are following is missing the bounding box, you can copy `ctrl+c` from the previous frame and then paste `ctrl+v` on the current frame, you can adjust the bounding box to where the crab is either by dragging with your mouse or use arrow keys.
- If the id you are following has been re-id (assign to a new id): - Go to the menu bar, choose the 6th icon after `help` (it looks like grid). - All the frames will be group in a grid style. - Choose `Group by` `region [track]` - the track number will be popped up next to it. - Choose the track number the id has been re-id. - For example: the original id is 9, the crab is now been re-id to 78. - Choose `78/188: track = 78` - the first number (78) not always the same with the second one (track = 78). Make sure the id we want is the second one. - Click Toggle Annotation Editor at the side. - if you has this shown, unclick and click again. - make sure the track shows the track you choose only instead of `xxx different values:...` - Change the track in there, from the one is being re-id to the original one. - for example from 78 to 9 - Then click anywhere (or enter), there will notification at the bottom of the window saying `updated region attribute of <how many> region` - Click the same icon again so you will get only one frame back. - See if the changes happened correctly. - You do not need to wait the grid images finished loading before doing any of the step above.
  > [!CAUTION]
  > There is no undo action make sure the id you put is correct. Try to save after every id or so.
- If the crab has been re-id for one frame and then lost track again, maybe, change in that frame will be easier than the grid method.
  - Just click the bounding box to get it highlighted.
  - The box with track and track number will be appeared (make sure the toggle annotation editor is closed by clicking the toggle annotation editor).
  - Simply key in the correct id there.
- If you start with first frame and go through from track id 1 to n, carry on to the next frames to see any new id or crabs.

> [!TIP]
>
> Browser:
>
> - I tried using Edge and Safari. Safari is more temperamental, randomly reload the page and you will lose the unsaved work. Save regularly. So far Edge has been good.

> Zooming in:
>
> - It is possible to zoom in the frame to label using the magnifying glass tool in the top bar.
> - However, I found that when I am zoomed in on the right hand side of the frame, if I switch to the next frame (with the left arrow), the zoom location is reset to the leftmost-side of the image. This is a bit annoying when labelling the right hand side of the image.
> - As a workaround I did the following (using Chrome, in a Mac): instead of zooming in the frame, we zoom in the whole browser window. To do this, I click on an empty area of the left side panel and zoom-in using the pinch gesture on the trackpad. This way we can zoom in on the right hand side of the image and also switch across frames without the zoom changing location.
> - For some reason, this pinch gesture is not equivalent to clicking the magnifying glass tool in Chrome - I'm not sure why

- Some convenient shortcuts:

  - Press `b` to toggle the boxes visibility
  - Press `l` to toggle the visibility of the boxes' IDs
  - Press `spacebar` to show the annotations for that frame

> [!CAUTION]
> There is no undo action in the annotation tool!

- Be sure to save frequently, at least every labelled frame
  - more on saving the annotations in steps 6 and 7.
- If you are using the "copy+paste" approach to reuse the annotations of the previous frame: note that the copied annotations stay in the clipboard after pasting!

  - Be careful that you don't press `v` accidentally, as that would paste all boxes again to the frame you are viewing (and deleting them one by one will be painful)

### 6. Export the annotations

We save our work in two formats: as a VIA json file and as csv annotations.

To save a VIA json file:

- In the top bar, click `Project` > `Save Project`
- Leave all settings `ON` (as by default) and click `OK` to export
- This generates a json file with the name `<project_name>.json` that we can load again later in VIA to continue labelling.

To export the annotations to COCO format:

- in the top menu, click `Annotation` > `Export annotations (as csv)`
- This will download a json file to your Downloads folder named `<project_name>_csv.csv`

> [!TIP]
>
> - Save the data frequently, at least every frame - remember there is no undo button! üò¨
> - It is simpler to save the data locally (to your laptop) to start with, rather than in `ceph`.

Once you are done with all your annotations for the frames you imported, please upload the 2 final json files (the VIA json file and COCO json file) to the subdirectory `annotations`, which is next to the extracted frames. In our previous example, that subdirectory would be:

<!-- TODO -->

```
/ceph/zoo/users/sminano/crabs_bboxes_labels/20230816_ramalhete2023_day2_combined/annotations
```
